# Fast Images

A modern, efficient image compression web application built with React and Node.js that allows users to compress and convert images to different formats while maintaining quality.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Support for multiple image formats (WebP, JPEG, PNG)
- üì¶ Batch processing with progress tracking
- üéöÔ∏è Adjustable compression quality
- üíæ Individual and bulk downloads
- ‚ö° Efficient caching mechanism
- üìä Real-time compression statistics
- üéØ Automatic optimization detection

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Axios
  - React Dropzone
  - Hero Icons
  - React Hot Toast

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Sharp (for image processing)
  - UUID
  - JSZip

## Key Features

### Batch Processing
- Images are processed in batches of 5
- Concurrent processing is limited to maintaining performance
- Progress tracking for each file

### Caching System
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation
- Automatically cleans up processed files after 1 hour
- Efficient memory management

### Optimization Detection
- Automatically detects if images are already optimized
- Prevents unnecessary compression
- Provides user feedback for optimized files
