## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Support for multiple image formats (WebP, JPEG, PNG)
- üì¶ Batch processing with progress tracking
- üéöÔ∏è Adjustable compression quality
- üíæ Individual and bulk downloads
- ‚ö° Efficient caching mechanism
- üìä Real-time compression statistics
- üéØ Automatic optimization detection

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Axios
  - React Dropzone
  - Hero Icons
  - React Hot Toast

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Sharp (for image processing)
  - UUID
  - JSZip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Pradhyumnaatmakur/fast-images
cd image-compressor
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

3. Start the development servers:
```bash
# Start backend server (from server directory)
npm start

# Start frontend development server (from client directory)
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Drag and drop images or click to select files
2. Choose the desired output format (WebP, JPEG, or PNG)
3. Adjust the quality slider (1-100)
4. Click "Compress Images" to start processing
5. Download individual images or use "Download All as ZIP"

## Key Features Explained

### Batch Processing
- Images are processed in batches of 5
- Concurrent processing is limited to maintain performance
- Progress tracking for each file

### Caching System
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation
- Automatically cleans up processed files after 1 hour
- Efficient memory management

### Optimization Detection
- Automatically detects if images are already optimized
- Prevents unnecessary compression
- Provides user feedback for optimized files

## API Endpoints
